Project 9: Protein analyzer

This Python program should contain classes and methods to analyze protein sequences and structures.
For this program you can use Biopython and other 3rd party packages.

•01.	A method to retrieve a set of SwissProt records when their IDs are given as a list
(in a text file).
This method should save their sequences in FASTA format in separate files.

•02.	A method that takes a set of protein sequences as an input (text/FASTA file)
and scan the Expasy Prosite database.
As the output, it should create a text file that prints the domain coordinates,
domain IDs and Domain names found for each sequence.
Please note that one input sequence can get multiple domain hits.

•03.	A method to download multiple PDB files when their PDB IDs are given as a list
(in a text file).
Moreover, this method should create a single FASTA file that contains all the
sequences of the downloaded PDB files in FASTA format
(you can include the PDB ID as the FASTA header).

•04.	A method that takes PDB file as an input and outputs the number of chains,
residues, and atoms for each residue in the protein (in a text file).

•05.	Write a new method to expand the above method to create separate text files
for multiple PDB files given as an input (A text file containing multiple PDB IDs).

•06.	Method that prints all the hetero (non-protein) residues of given PDB file.

•07.	A method that outputs the coordinates of a given atom (S, C-alpha, N, O, etc.)

01.
Overwhelming the UniProt servers means sending too many requests in a short time, which can cause **rate limiting**,
temporary IP bans, or server slowdowns.

### **Why `time.sleep(1)`?**
- It **pauses the script for 1 second** between requests.
- This **prevents flooding UniProt** with too many queries at once.
- UniProt may **block your IP** if requests are too frequent.

### **Can I Remove `time.sleep(1)`?**
Yes, but:
- If you have **only a few IDs**, removing it is fine.
- If fetching **many records**, UniProt **might refuse** your requests.

### **Alternative Approach:**
Instead of `time.sleep(1)`, you can:
- **Batch queries** (fetch multiple records in one request).
- **Check UniProt API rate limits** and adjust accordingly.
