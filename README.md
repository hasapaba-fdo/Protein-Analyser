ðŸ§¬ Protein Sequence and Structure Analyzer

This project is a Python-based toolkit designed to analyze protein sequences and structures using Biopython and other third-party bioinformatics packages. It provides an organized, class-oriented approach to handling protein data by integrating functionalities such as sequence retrieval, domain scanning, structural parsing, and atomic-level analysis. The program is particularly useful for bioinformatics researchers who work with protein datasets from databases like SwissProt, Expasy Prosite, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

The first feature of the program retrieves SwissProt records for a given list of protein IDs provided in a text file. Each retrieved record is saved as a separate FASTA file containing the corresponding amino acid sequence. The second component of the project enables scanning of protein sequences against the Expasy Prosite database. When a set of sequences is supplied (in text or FASTA format), the method identifies all matching domains, recording their coordinates, domain IDs, and names in a single text output. Since multiple domains can be identified within one sequence, the tool reports all relevant hits for comprehensive annotation.

Another important function of this toolkit is the ability to download multiple PDB structures based on a list of PDB IDs provided by the user. Once downloaded, all sequences extracted from the PDB files are compiled into a single FASTA file, with each PDB ID included as the FASTA header for easy reference. The program also includes a structural analysis feature that processes individual PDB files to report the number of chains, residues, and atoms associated with each residue. The output is written to a text file summarizing the key structural details of the protein.

For batch processing, the toolkit extends this capability by allowing multiple PDB IDs to be analyzed automatically. Separate text summaries are generated for each PDB file, providing chain, residue, and atom information in a structured manner. Additionally, the project includes a method to identify and list all hetero residues â€” that is, non-protein components such as ligands or cofactors â€” present within a PDB file. This helps users distinguish between protein and non-protein parts of a structure. Another specialized method extracts the 3D coordinates of a specified atom (such as sulfur, carbon-alpha, nitrogen, or oxygen) from a PDB structure, allowing users to inspect atomic positions within the protein.

The project has been implemented in Python 3, primarily using the Biopython library, along with standard modules such as requests, urllib, and pandas for data handling and retrieval. Its modular design ensures that each method can be used independently or combined as part of a larger workflow. All results are stored in clearly labeled text or FASTA files for further downstream analysis. The tool provides a foundation for bioinformatics studies involving protein function, domain architecture, and structural properties, and can be extended to include advanced features such as InterProScan, Pfam, or 3D visualization using PyMOL or nglview.

This repository has been developed and maintained by Dewmi Fernando.

Future Improvements: Possible future extensions include integration with InterProScan or Pfam databases for broader domain identification, enhanced visualization options using PyMOL API or nglview, improved command-line interfaces with error handling, and the addition of automated summary reports for large-scale structural datasets.
